## Description

These codes are the official evaluation protocol implementation for Total-Text. Two methods are made available: Deteval and Pascal VOC protocols.

Newly added feature - 'Do not care' candidates filtering is now available in the latest [Python_scripts](https://github.com/cs-chan/Total-Text-Dataset/tree/master/Evaluation_Protocol/Python_scripts) folder.

### Deteval
We recommend tr = 0.7 and tp = 0.6 threshold for a fairer evaluation with polygon ground-truth and detection format.

### Pascal VOC
The conventional 0.5 threshold works fine.
